# Sakhya

A minimal, fully working WhatsApp-style messaging and calling app. Real-time chat, friend
requests, blocking, voice/video calling over WebRTC, notifications, and call history — all
running entirely on your machine with SQLite. No cloud services, no external accounts
required.

This repo has been built, then substantially polished into a mobile-first v1.0: a Facebook-style
multi-step onboarding flow, light/dark/system theming, a bottom nav on mobile with a desktop
top nav, skeleton loaders, date-grouped call logs and notifications, and several real
performance fixes (see "Performance notes" below). Every change was verified against the
running backend and Socket.IO connection during development.

## Tech stack

- **Frontend:** Next.js 15 (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4 (with class-based dark
  mode), custom Tailwind-based component primitives (Button/Input/Avatar/Badge/Skeleton —
  hand-built rather than pulled from the shadcn CLI registry, since this environment has no
  network access to it, but styled in the same spirit: unstyled-primitive + utility classes)
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Socket.IO, WebRTC signaling
- **Database:** SQLite via `better-sqlite3` (zero external services, file-based, with a
  lightweight migration path so upgrading an existing local DB doesn't require deleting data)
- **Auth:** JWT + bcrypt password hashing

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- A modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) — camera/microphone access is required
  for calling and only works on `localhost` or HTTPS.

## Installation & running

Sakhya is configured as a single workspace. You do **not** need to start the frontend and
backend separately.

### 1. Install everything

From the Sakhya root directory:

```bash
npm install
```

The root workspace installs dependencies for both `client` and `server`.

### 2. Development mode

Run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This single command starts:

- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
- Backend/API + Socket.IO: `http://localhost:4000`

The required local environment files are created automatically when needed.

Press `Ctrl+C` once to stop both services.

### 3. Production mode

Run:

```bash
npm start
```

If a production build does not exist, Sakhya automatically runs the build first. It then starts
both the backend and frontend with the same command.

You can also build manually:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Open **http://localhost:3000** in two different browsers (or one normal + one incognito
window) to simulate two separate users.

## Trying it out end-to-end

1. Go through the multi-step sign-up flow (name → date of birth → gender → email →
   password) in two browser windows to create two accounts. A username is generated for you
   automatically from your name (editable later in Profile).
2. From window A, open the **Friends** tab, search for the other account's username, and
   send a friend request.
3. From window B, open **Friends → Requests** — accept it.
4. Open **Chats**, select the conversation, and send messages — typing indicators and
   delivered/seen ticks update live.
5. Tap the phone or video icon in the chat header to start a call; the other window shows an
   incoming-call screen with accept/decline, then a live call screen with mute/camera/end
   controls and a running duration.
6. Check **Calls** for the logged entry, grouped under Today/Yesterday/Older.
7. Trigger a friend request, message, and missed call, then check **Notifications**, also
   grouped by date, with "mark all as read".
8. Try **Friends → Block** on a friend — they disappear from your friends list and can no
   longer message, call, or re-add you until you unblock them from **Friends → Blocked** (or
   **Settings → Privacy → Blocked users**).
9. In **Settings**, switch between Light / Dark / System appearance.
10. Log out and log back in — all messages, friends, blocks, and call history persist in
    SQLite.

## Performance notes

A few concrete fixes worth calling out, since "make it faster" is otherwise hard to verify:

- **Chat list no longer refetches on every message.** It used to call the REST API and
  reload every conversation on each `receive_message`/`message_seen` socket event. It now
  patches the affected conversation's `lastMessage`/`unreadCount` in place and re-sorts
  locally — O(1) socket handling instead of a full round-trip per event.
- **Message bubbles and chat-list rows are memoized** (`React.memo`) so a new message or an
  unrelated state change doesn't re-render the entire scrollback/list.
- **The WebRTC call UI is code-split** via a client-only lazy import, so it isn't included in
  the JS bundle for the login/register routes, which never need it.
- **Skeleton loaders** replace spinners on the chat list, chat window, calls, notifications,
  and friends pages, so the layout doesn't jump and perceived load feels instant.
- Search inputs (friend search) are debounced (250ms) instead of firing a request per
  keystroke.
- Theme is applied via a tiny inline script before hydration, so there's no flash of the
  wrong theme on load; the whole palette is CSS custom properties, so light/dark needs no
  per-component `dark:` class management.

## REST API

## Database schema

SQLite tables (auto-created/migrated on server start): `users` (now includes `firstName`,
`lastName`, `dateOfBirth`, `gender`), `sessions`, `friend_requests`, `friends`,
`blocked_users`, `messages`, `calls`, `notifications`. See `server/src/db/index.ts` for the
full schema. If you have an existing `sakhya.db` from before this update, it will be
auto-migrated in place the next time the server starts — no need to delete it.

## Notes & scope

- Calling uses public Google STUN servers for NAT traversal (no TURN server is included,
  so calls between two devices on very restrictive/symmetric NATs may not connect — this is
  a standard limitation of a STUN-only WebRTC setup).
- Only text messages are supported (no media/stickers/reactions), matching the MVP scope.
- Messages cannot be edited or deleted, matching the MVP scope.
- No screen sharing, matching the MVP scope.
- "Forgot password" is a placeholder — there's no email service in this local-only MVP, so
  it explains that rather than pretending to send an email.
- No group chats, stories, or any of the other explicitly-excluded features.


### Navigation performance

Primary navigation uses Next.js `Link` directly. Manual hover/touch prefetching and global route warmup were removed to prevent competing route requests that could make tab navigation feel delayed or require repeated clicks, especially in development.

### Phase 6 privacy features

Sakhya supports disappearing messages and view-once messages while keeping message plaintext encrypted on the client. Expiry cleanup and view-once claiming are enforced server-side.

## Security status
Sakhya includes browser-local E2EE v2/Double-Ratchet-oriented sessions, device-bound keys, and a v3 multi-device delivery envelope. Each active recipient device can receive its own encrypted ciphertext. This is a security-focused foundation, not a claim of Signal-grade or independently audited cryptography.


## Phase 7 — Encrypted media and smooth UX
- Client-side encrypted image, video, audio/voice, and file attachments.
- Encrypted media blobs are stored server-side without plaintext content.
- Privacy-safe chat previews never expose E2EE ciphertext.
- Settings layout is constrained to the viewport with horizontal overflow protection.
- Primary navigation uses idle route prefetching and cached calls data to reduce transition latency and repeated clicks.


## Phase 9 — Multi-device encrypted delivery
- Per-recipient-device encrypted message entries.
- Device-scoped ratchet sessions.
- Atomic one-time-prekey consumption for device session establishment.
- Sender-only encrypted history copy.
- Safe fallback to v2 when a recipient has no device crypto bundle.
- Revoked devices are excluded from active device discovery.
